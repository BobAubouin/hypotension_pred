  abstract = {The Hypotension Prediction Index is a proprietary prediction model incorporated into a commercially available intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring system. The Hypotension Prediction Index uses multiple features of the arterial blood pressure waveform to predict hypotension. The index publication introducing the Hypotension Prediction Index describes the selection of training and validation data. Although precise details of the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm are proprietary, the authors describe a selection process whereby a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 75 mmHg will always predict hypotension. We hypothesize that the data selection process introduced a systematic bias that resulted in an overestimation of the current MAP value's ability to predict future hypotension. Since current MAP is a predictive variable contributing to Hypotension Prediction Index, this exaggerated predictive performance likely also applies to the corresponding Hypotension Prediction Index value. Other existing validation studies appear similarly problematic, suggesting that additional validation work and, potentially, updates to the Hypotension Prediction Index model may be necessary.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict intraoperative hypotension may advance the ability to prevent hypotension-associated complications effectivelyThe extent to which advanced waveform analysis of invasive arterial lines may provide meaningful forewarning remains unknownA machine-learning algorithm based on thousands of arterial waveform features can identify an intraoperative hypotensive event 15 min before its occurrence with a sensitivity of 88\% and specificity of 87\%Further studies must evaluate the real-time value of such algorithms in a broader set of clinical conditions and patientsWith appropriate algorithms, computers can learn to detect patterns and associations in large data sets. The authors' goal was to apply machine learning to arterial pressure waveforms and create an algorithm to predict hypotension. The algorithm detects early alteration in waveforms that can herald the weakening of cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms affecting preload, afterload, and contractility.The algorithm was developed with two different data sources: (1) a retrospective cohort, used for training, consisting of 1,334 patients' records with 545,959 min of arterial waveform recording and 25,461 episodes of hypotension; and (2) a prospective, local hospital cohort used for external validation, consisting of 204 patients' records with 33,236 min of arterial waveform recording and 1,923 episodes of hypotension. The algorithm relates a large set of features calculated from the high-fidelity arterial pressure waveform to the prediction of an upcoming hypotensive event (mean arterial pressure \&lt; 65 mmHg). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the algorithm's success in predicting hypotension, defined as mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg.Using 3,022 individual features per cardiac cycle, the algorithm predicted arterial hypotension with a sensitivity and specificity of 88\% (85 to 90\%) and 87\% (85 to 90\%) 15 min before a hypotensive event (area under the curve, 0.95 [0.94 to 0.95]); 89\% (87 to 91\%) and 90\% (87 to 92\%) 10 min before (area under the curve, 0.95 [0.95 to 0.96]); 92\% (90 to 94\%) and 92\% (90 to 94\%) 5 min before (area under the curve, 0.97 [0.97 to 0.98]).The results demonstrate that a machine-learning algorithm can be trained, with large data sets of high-fidelity arterial waveforms, to predict hypotension in surgical patients' records.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~           Hypotension prediction index (HPI) software is a proprietary machine learning-based algorithm used to predict intraoperative hypotension (IOH). HPI has shown superiority in predicting IOH when compared to the predictive value of changes in mean arterial pressure ({$\Delta$}MAP) alone. However, the predictive value of {$\Delta$}MAP alone, with no reference to the absolute level of MAP, is counterintuitive and poor at predicting IOH. A simple linear extrapolation of mean arterial pressure (LepMAP) is closer to the clinical approach.           OBJECTIVES~           Our primary objective was to investigate whether LepMAP better predicts IOH than {$\Delta$}MAP alone.           DESIGN~           Retrospective diagnostic accuracy study.           SETTING~           Two tertiary University Hospitals between May 2019 and December 2019.           PATIENTS~           A total of 83 adult patients undergoing high risk non-cardiac surgery.           DATA SOURCES~           Arterial pressure data were automatically extracted from the anaesthesia data collection software (one value per minute). IOH was defined as MAP {$<$} 65 mmHg.           ANALYSIS~           Correlations for repeated measurements and the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were determined for the ability of LepMAP and {$\Delta$}MAP to predict IOH at 1, 2 and 5 min before its occurrence (A-analysis, using the whole dataset). Data were also analysed after exclusion of MAP values between 65 and 75 mmHg (B-analysis).           RESULTS~           A total of 24 318 segments of ten minutes duration were analysed. In the A-analysis, ROC AUCs to predict IOH at 1, 2 and 5 min before its occurrence by LepMAP were 0.87 (95\% confidence interval, CI, 0.86 to 0.88), 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.79 to 0.83) and 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.71) and for {$\Delta$}MAP alone 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.62), 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.59 to 0.64), 0.57 (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.69), respectively. In the B analysis for LepMAP these were 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.9 to 0.98), 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.92 to 0.95) and 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.84 to 0.88), respectively, and for {$\Delta$}MAP alone 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.58), 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.59), 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.51 to 0.57), respectively. LepMAP ROC AUCs were significantly higher than {$\Delta$}MAP ROC AUCs in all cases.           CONCLUSIONS~           LepMAP provides reliable real-time and continuous prediction of IOH 1 and 2 min before its occurrence. LepMAP offers better discrimination than {$\Delta$}MAP at 1, 2 and 5 min before its occurrence. Future studies evaluating machine learning algorithms to predict IOH should be compared with LepMAP rather than {$\Delta$}MAP.},

  abstract = {Problem framing is critical to developing risk prediction models because all subsequent development work and evaluation takes place within the context of how a problem has been framed and explicit documentation of framing choices makes it easier to compare evaluation metrics between published studies. In this work, we introduce the basic concepts of framing, including prediction windows, observation windows, window shifts and event-triggers for a prediction that strongly affects the risk of clinician fatigue caused by false positives. Building on this, we apply four different framing structures to the same generic dataset, using a sepsis risk prediction model as an example, and evaluate how framing affects model performance and learning. Our results show that an apparently good model with strong evaluation results in both discrimination and calibration is not necessarily clinically usable. Therefore, it is important to assess the results of objective evaluations within the context of more subjective evaluations of how a model is framed.},

  abstract = {Background Intraoperative hypotension is associated with a risk of postoperative organ dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to present deep learning algorithms for real-time predictions 5, 10, and 15 min before a hypotensive event. Methods In this retrospective observational study, deep learning algorithms were developed and validated using biosignal waveforms acquired from patient monitoring of noncardiac surgery. The classification model was a binary classifier of a hypotensive event (MAP {$<$}65 mm Hg) or a non-hypotensive event by analysing biosignal waveforms. The regression model was developed to directly estimate the MAP. The primary outcome was area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and the mean absolute error (MAE). Results In total, 3301 patients were included. For invasive models, the multichannel model with an arterial pressure waveform, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and capnography showed greater AUROC than the arterial-pressure-only models (AUROC15-min, 0.897 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}: 0.894--0.900] vs 0.891 [95\% CI: 0.888--0.894]) and lesser MAE (MAE15-min, 7.76 mm Hg [95\% CI: 7.64--7.87 mm Hg] vs 8.12 mm Hg [95\% CI: 8.02--8.21 mm Hg]). For the noninvasive models, the multichannel model showed greater AUROCs than that of the photoplethysmography-only models (AUROC15-min, 0.762 [95\% CI: 0.756--0.767] vs 0.694 [95\% CI: 0.686--0.702]) and lesser MAEs (MAE15-min, 11.68 mm Hg [95\% CI: 11.57--11.80 mm Hg] vs 12.67 [95\% CI: 12.56--12.79 mm Hg]). Conclusions Deep learning models can predict hypotensive events based on biosignals acquired using invasive and noninvasive patient monitoring. In addition, the model shows better performance when using combined rather than single signals.},

The VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open dataset created specifically to facilitate machine learning studies related to monitoring vital signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is stored in the public cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed and analysed using application programming interfaces and Python library. The VitalDB public dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for biosignal research and development.},
